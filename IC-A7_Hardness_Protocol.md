# Vickers Hardness Testing Protocol for IC-A7

## Component
IC-A7 integrated circuit

## Instrument
CSM Instruments Nano Hardness Tester (NHT)

## Target
Gold bonding pads

## Measurement Sites
Localized hardness measurements shall be taken at the following specific sites on each bonding pad:

- **Site 1:** Geometric center of the pad.
- **Site 2:** 10 µm from the north‑west edge of the pad.
- **Site 3:** 10 µm from the south‑east edge of the pad.

## Acceptance Criteria
The Vickers Hardness (HV) of the gold bonding pads must fall within the range **80 HV – 95 HV**. Measurements outside this range indicate non‑conformance and shall trigger a failure investigation.

## Procedure
1. Mount the IC‑A7 sample securely on the NHT stage.
2. Using the microscope, locate the bonding pad of interest.
3. Position the indenter tip at the first measurement site (center).
4. Apply the standard test load (e.g., 10 mN) and hold for 10 seconds.
5. Record the hardness value displayed by the NHT software.
6. Repeat steps 3–5 for Sites 2 and 3.
7. Compare each measured HV value against the acceptance range.
8. Document all results in the quality‑control log sheet.

## Notes
- Ensure the indenter is calibrated according to the manufacturer’s schedule.
- Clean the pad surface with an appropriate solvent before testing to remove any contaminants.
- If a pad fails the hardness test, repeat the measurement on a second pad of the same batch to confirm the result.
